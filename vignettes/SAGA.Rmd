### Application Purpose

Stock assessments analyze and report fish population dynamics including information on changes in abundance of fishery stocks in response to fishing and the environment. Population models utilize fishery-independent data to estimate a time series of population abundance, size and age composition, and fishing mortality. The NEFSC Bottom Trawl Surveys are the longest running, continuous time-series of bottom fish and marine invertebrate sampling in the world and one of the main sources of fishery-independent data used in stock assessments in the Northeastern United States. The original survey analysis software was a Fortran program known as SURVAN. It evolved into SAGA (Survey Area Graphical Analysis) which was developed as an interactive tool for assessment scientists to pull survey data from the Oracle database with various user specifications (species, years, seasons, strata, gear and vessel calibrations, etc.). With recent updates this application has depreciated and is no longer supported. Consequently, this new Shiny SAGA application was developed. Static results of the survey has also been developed in an Oracle framework within a stock assessment system known as StockEff.

#### User Specifications

Under the **Survey Indices** section, the user populates the widgets in the interface (Oracle username and password, strata, species, season, range of years, range of lengths/ages, tow evaluation specifics, and calibration settings) and then clicks the **RUN** button to begin the query/analysis. A status bar showing progress then appears in the bottom right corner of the page until the process is complete and a plot of the indices over time is displayed. A **Help** tab can be found in the dashboard that provides guidance on the various user specifications.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
image.dir <- "images/"
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir,"SAGA.png"))
```

#### App Results

Survey indices and raw catch data are available for download using the **Download .csv Data** or **Download RData** buttons. A **Maps** tab shows an interactive Leaflet map of the survey catch data based on the user specifications going into the index calculation. This map can be saved as an html file by clicking the **Download Map** button.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir,"SAGAMap.png"))
```

### How often is it used? 

This app is useful anytime an assessment scientist or manager is interested in evaluating different spatial and/or temporal specifications for stocks, different length and age calculations, gear and vessel calibrations, or tow success criteria. It also provides data that can be used to explore spatial and temporal trends in survey catches. As an app that allows examination of alternative survey analyses in real time, it may also be useful during stock assessment review meetings to help answer questions.
